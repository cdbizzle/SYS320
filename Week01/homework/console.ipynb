    "1. The user that was authenticated was 'test'. From a security analyst standpoint this could look totally non-threatening becuase it seems like someone who was suposed to be there was the one doing the SSH. But at the same time, this could be an attack stratagy from a malicous actor.\n",
    "2. I liked how simple this lab was once we completed the meat of the assignement. From there it was smooth sailing as we changed was we wanted the script to spit out.\n",
    "3. I want to better understand how the backslashes work. For example: \"sshd\\(pam_unix\\)\""
